# H.A.T.-for-Agisofts-Photoscan-Professional
In the last few years SfM has taken on a more important part in the research and documentation of archaeological sites. The benefits of 3D documentation are manifold: areas and contexts can be recorded quickly, true to scale and transformed into a 3D model.

I use Agisoft Photoscan Professional for the documentation of finds, features and archaeological profiles. With the help of python codes it is possible to automate the workflow.
